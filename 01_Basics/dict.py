"""
If we want to represent a group of values as key-value pairs then we should go for dict data type.

In javascript this is called object

Note: dict is mutable and the order wont be preserved.

In general we can use bytes and bytearray data types to represent binary information like images,video files etc

In Python there is no char data type. Hence we can represent char values also by using str type.

print(d)

a['c']= 'cat'
a['b'] = 'ball'
